smart keyboard

----

The idea is to have the base keyboard functionality, but instead of spelling correction, use entity detection to intelligently suggest contextually relevant information.  This will start with Yelp for restaurant names (Yelp deep link), and then potentially move to movies (fandango deep link) or music entities (spotify deep link).
